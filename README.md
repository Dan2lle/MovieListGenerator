# TV Show Bucket List

## Always Give What You Want

This application can **collect** tv shows of every individual users' 
choices, show the list by *rating or category*, **delete** or mark a 
tv show as **completed**. 

Everyone who like to watch tv shows or even movies can use this 
application.

This project is interesting to me because I like to watch all kinds 
of tv shows to release stress or just spend time, but sometimes it 
takes me a lot of time to find the one I want to watch on the Internet.
With a tv show bucket list, when I really want to watch something, I 
can quickly search one from the collections of tv shows that I have 
saved before.
