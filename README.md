# Drama Bucket List

## Always Give What You Want

This application can **collect** dramas of every individual users' 
choices, show the list by *category*, **delete** or mark a 
drama as **completed**. 

Everyone who like to watch dramas can use this application.

This project is interesting to me because I like to watch dramas to release 
stress or just spend time, but it always takes me a lot of time to find 
the one I want to watch on the Internet. With a drama bucket list, when I 
really want to watch something, I can quickly search one from the collections
of dramas that I have saved before.
