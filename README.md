# TV Show Bucket List

## Always Give What You Want

This application can **collect** TV shows of every individual users' 
choices, show the list by *category*, **delete** or mark a 
TV show as **completed**. 

Everyone who likes to watch TV shows can use this application.

This project is interesting to me because I like to watch TV shows to release 
stress or just spend time, but it always takes me a lot of time to find 
the one attracts me on the Internet. With a TV show bucket list, when I 
really want to watch something, I can quickly search one from the collections that I have saved before.
